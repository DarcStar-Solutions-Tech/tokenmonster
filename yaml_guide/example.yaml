#
# YAML vocabulary can be used to create a new vocabulary or modify an existing vocabulary.
# Note that indentation must be done with 2 spaces and not with tabs.
#

# The following variables only affect a new vocabulary and will not modify an existing one:
charset: "utf-8"           # has no effect on an existing vocabulary
capcode: 2                 # has no effect on an existing vocabulary
normalization: "nfd"       # multiple normalizations can be applied: nfd lowercase accents quotemarks collapse trim leadingspace unixlines

# The following variables will modify an existing vocabulary if present
include-256-bytes: false
include-128-bytes: false
include-utf8-bytes: false
include-ascii-bytes: false
include-extended-bytes: false
exclude-other-bytes: false
unk: true                  # whether to assigned an ID for an UNK token
unk-id: 20000              # optionally assign an ID to the UNK token (if exists)
reset-token-ids: false     # if true, ids will be ignored and assigned from zero alphabetically

# Regular tokens and single byte tokens
tokens:
  - token:   "token1"
    id:      27            # id field is optional
    score:   0.127         # score field is optional
    encoded: true          # if false, normalization and capcode will be applied to the token before adding it
  - token:   "token2"
  - token:   "TokenMonsterHexEncode{ff}" # you can provide the token hex encoded like this

# Regular tokens cannot contain special tokens, any that do will be ignored/deleted
special:
  - token:   "<SPECIAL1>"  # special tokens should not begin with a letter or number
    id:      1000          # id & score fields are optional
    score:   0.002
  - token:   "<SPECIAL2>"

# Tokens specified under "delete" will be deleted
delete:
  - token:   " token"      # deletes by token
    encoded: false         # if false normalization and capcode will be applied before searching for it to delete
  - id:      77            # deletes by ID
